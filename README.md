# cherubplay-chat-exporter
This tool is designed to export chat logs from the Homestuck roleplay website Cherubplay (https://www.cherubplay.co.uk/)

The tool is currently functional, but is still a work in progress! I created this tool almost a year ago for a friend when their chatlog became hundreds of pages long and would take too long to manually copy and paste into a Word document. I recently started working on it again when the site's format changed and rendered the tool useless.

Some things missing from the tool includes:

1. Updating the UI in real time to give live updates, such as "3/41 pages exported"

3. Additional option to export OOC messages by accepting username and password
